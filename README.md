# Belly-Button-Analysis

## Purpose of Project
The purpose of this project is to help Roza build a dashboard that both research participants and fellow researchers can visit to see what types of bacteria are residing in the belly buttons. We will be building an interactive dashboard that is linked to the Test Subject ID Numbers for each individual and it will allow you to pull up their specific data.
